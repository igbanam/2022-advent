# The `crates =` bit below may be a bit confusing. This is what I'm trying to
# achieve here. We have the crates specification as a visual representation. I
# want to take this, and make it a list of arrays with the zeroth element at the
# bottom. This way, `crates[0][0]` in the puzzle input is 'S', and
# `crates[8][0]` should be H.
#
# This is a miniature ETL of sorts. I'll explain each step as a comment
